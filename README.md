# Laravel 7 Test Project
Basics of Laravel

In this project i designed models, created migrations and controllers, filled the database by using seeds, created couple of views and performed CRUD operations.
For the ORM used Eloquent.
To test it create a database named ` taskblog ` or you can change it in ` .env ` to your database name and then try to use this project.
